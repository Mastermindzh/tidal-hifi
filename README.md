### Known bugs

#### last.fm doesn't work out of the box. Use rescrobbler as a workaround

The last.fm login doesn't work, as is evident from the following issue: [Last.fm login doesn't work](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/tidal-hifi/issues/4).
However, in that same issue you can read about a workaround using [rescrobbler](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled).
For now that will be the default workaround.

## Why

I moved from Spotify over to Tidal and found Linux support to be lacking.

When I started this project there weren't any Linux apps that offered Tidal's "hifi" options nor any scripts to control it.

## Why not extend existing projects?

Whilst there are a handful of projects attempting to run Tidal on Electron they are all unappealing to me because of various reasons:

- Lack of a maintainers/developers. (no hotfixes, no issues being handled etc)
- Most are simple web wrappers, not my cup of tea.
- Some are DE oriented. I want this to work on WM's too.
- None have widevine working at the moment

Sometimes it's just easier to start over, cover my own needs and then making it available to the public :)

## Special thanks to...

- [Castlabs](https://castlabs.com/)
  For maintaining Electron with Widevine CDM installation, Verified Media Path (VMP), and persistent licenses (StorageID)
