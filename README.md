## Why did I create TIDAL Hi-Fi?

I moved from Spotify over to Tidal and found Linux support to be lacking.
When I started this project there weren't any Linux apps that offered Tidal's "hifi" options nor any scripts to control it.
I made this app to support the highest quality audio available on the Linux platform. It used to be "hifi" but now is ["High & Max"](https://tidal.com/sound-quality).

### Why not extend existing projects?

Whilst there are a handful of projects attempting to run Tidal on Electron they are all unappealing to me because of various reasons:

- Lack of maintainers/developers. (no hotfixes, no issues being handled etc)
- Most are simple web wrappers, not my cup of tea.
- Some are DE-oriented. I want this to work on WM's too.
- None have Widevine working at the moment

Sometimes it's just easier to start over, cover my own needs and after that making it available to the public :)

## Installation

### Dependencies

Note that you **need** a notification library such as [libnotify](https://github.com/GNOME/libnotify) or [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for the software to work properly.

### Using releases

Various packaged versions of the software are available on the [releases](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/tidal-hifi/releases) tab.

### Snap

To install with `snap` you need to download the pre-packaged snap-package from this repository, found under releases:

1. Download

   ```sh
   wget <URI> #for instance: https://github.com/Mastermindzh/tidal-hifi/releases/download/1.0/tidal-hifi_1.0.0_amd64.snap
   ```

2. Install

   ```sh
   snap install --dangerous <path> #for instance: tidal-hifi_1.0.0_amd64.snap
   ```

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can use the AUR to install TIDAL Hi-Fi:

```sh

```

### Flatpak

To install via [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.mastermindzh.tidal-hifi) run the following command:

```sh
flatpak install flathub com.mastermindzh.tidal-hifi
```

### Nix

To install with Nix run the following command:

```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.tidal-hifi
```

### Using source

To install and work with the code on this project follow these steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/Mastermindzh/tidal-hifi.git`
- `cd tidal-hifi`
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch` to watch for auto-reload of Typescript/SCSS changes.
  - `npm run compile` can be used to trigger it once
- `npm watchStart` to auto watch for any updates files and reload Tidal Hi-Fi
  - `npm start` can be used to run Tidal Hi-Fi manually once

## Integrations

TIDAL Hi-Fi comes with several integrations out of the box.
You can find these in the settings menu (`ctrl + =` by default) under the "integrations" tab.

![integrations menu, showing a list of integrations](./docs/images/integrations.png)

Integrations with other projects that are not included natively:

- [i3 blocks config](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/dotfiles/commit/9714b2fa1d670108ce811d5511fd3b7a43180647) - My dotfiles where I use this app to fetch currently playing music (direct commit)
- [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) third party plugins & theming

## Known bugs

### DRM not working on Windows (error S6007)

Most Windows users run into DRM issues when trying to use TIDAL Hi-Fi.
Nothing I can do about that I'm afraid... Tidal is working on removing/changing DRM so when they finish with that we can give it another shot.

Until then you'll have to use the official app unfortunately.
